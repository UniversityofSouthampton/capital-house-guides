Learning to code can seem daunting, but the only way to get better is through exposure! There are thousands of tutorials online all with unique learning styles. The best way to learn coding is by doing it, and in this post, I will recommend some resources to get you started!

## Official Series by Unity: Beginner Scripting

**This series assumes basic knowledge of Unity so it is recommended that you first complete the "Unity - Introduction" guide.** The guide includes pre-written code but does not expect you to write your own. Once you have completed it, you may want to learn more about the individual elements and structures which make up a script, in which case this series is perfect for you.

#### Script Editor

The guide uses an older version of Visual Studio as the script editor. You should use Rider as your editor (see Unity - Introduction guide for steps on how to set your default script editor.)

I strongly recommend watching these videos:

- Scripts as Behaviour Components

- Variables and Functions

- Conventions and Syntax

- IF Statements

- Loops

- Scope and Access Modifiers

- Awake and Start

- Update and FixedUpdate

- Vector Maths

Feel free to watch more of the series if you wish!

## CodeCademy

CodeCademy is a website which provides interactable coding courses, meaning you will learn by practice!  
Their C# course is free and will give you a good foundation of the features and syntax of C#  
If you prefer to learn at your own pace by following a written guide, you will enjoy this course.  

I recommend completing all of the tutorials up until (and including) Methods.

#### Notice

CodeCademy will teach you the general basics of C#. While all of the knowledge covered by the course is transferrable to Unity, keep in mind that there are certain Unity-specific features that this course won't cover.
