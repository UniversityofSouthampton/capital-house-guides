title: Technical Sessions

Each week, you will have what is broadly called a "Technical Session". A three hour slot especially dedicated to technical learning and practice. It is important to note that this is not a replacement for independent study, but is there to offer structure and guidance should you need it.

A typical technical session will consist of:
- A short introduction to a particular skill, concept or demo
- Time for practice and experimentation, focusing on the weekly topic or otherwise
- Opportunity to ask questions and seek support, about the weekly topic or otherwise.

Further in the year, as goals and ambitions become clearer, sessions will be pivoted towards individual support with an opportunity to request future topics to be demonstrated.
## Timetable
First Year: Thursday 13:30-16:30
Second Year: Thursday 10:30-12:30
Third Year: Tuesday 10:30-12:30

There is a timetable of planned topics written outside of the computer suite. This is subject to change so keep an eye on the timetable and most importantly Slack for any updates.
## Attendance
Not all highlighted topics might be relevant to all students, such you are not forced to engage with the content unless you want to. Some sessions will introduce crucial software that you will need to use for your degree, but this will be communicated to you beforehand.

It is a timetabled session, so attendance is taken. **You are expected to be in the studio during this time**, but unlike the academic sessions, you are not forced to engage with the content and may work independently in the computer suite or studio.
## Coding Help
Programming is a skill that is picked up at different rates and is a field where the retention of knowledge is strongly dependent on practice. This will be introduced to you gradually through other topics, and later in the year you should try and allocate some time throughout the week for practice. It may seem daunting at first, but is one of those things that you need to practice and it will become easier. Please feel free to ask for individual support at any time or if you are not sure where to start!
