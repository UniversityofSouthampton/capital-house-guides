title: What is The Tech Stream

I strongly recommend reading [[0_Art isn't in the Tools|Art isn't in the Tools]] before this page, as it provides an important preface to understanding the purpose of the tech stream.
# Supplement, not replacement
Whatever specialty you are looking to get into, whether its Games Design, Character Art, Games Narrative, Level Design, User Experience design, etc, you will need to be familiar with `INSERT INDUSTRY STANDARD TOOLS HERE`. You will need to be familiar with tools that programmers and engineers use, in the same way a great game programmer would need to understand the pipelines, restrictions, and formats that an artist is involved with.

These hard skills are infinitely wide, and infinitely deep. It is simply impossible to cover everything. Even if it was, knowing every technical detail of game development will not guarantee that your final product is good. Don't get me wrong, it is very, very important to know how to use your tools. But as we know, tools change. 

> [!Important Truth]
> **Your technical journey is a self-directed one. You will need to - in parallel to your art studies - take responsibility to learn, explore, and experiment with any relevant tools. Be that Unity, Godot, Blender, Maya, Kirta, Aseprite, etc. The priority of what to tackle first will differ from person to person.** 

Luckily, you do not have to do this alone!

üë®‚ÄçüíªThe tech stream exists to supplement your technical learning and practice in parallel to your art study. This includes a weekly technical session, a database of guides and resources, and access to an on-site game development technician (Ross)
