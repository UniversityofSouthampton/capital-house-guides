# The Dilemma

Assuming your end goal is to work in the games industry, or an adjacent creative sector, you may assume that studios and workplaces have rigid hard skill requirements ("you must know how to use this specific games engine, you must know how to use this specific program, you must know the ins and outs of coding") This is not entirety the case. Hard skills like that can be learned by anyone with access to YouTube and time. 

Try and change your mindset from "By the end of my time at WSA I want to know how to make a game" to "By the end of my time at WSA I want to be a great game-maker". It is an important distinction that will allow you to gain most from your time here. Anyone can learn to code, but it takes knowledge (and a lot of practice) to create games that speak to people. This is less easy to learn from YouTube as it requires wider context of art, of human psychology, and a deep love for the subject that you are embuding into your work.

Toby Fox, creator of Undertale and Deltarune, began his creative journey in music, studying piano and trumpet in school. He then studied environmental science at university. He himself claims to not be a great programmer, but this has had very little to no effect on the reach of his work.

Phil Fish, creator of FEZ, studied "Design and Digital Art for Video Games", a course very similar to the one you are on now. Again, he himself claimed that he "still has little to no idea about programming". Yet his game sold over a million copies and has become a cult classic.

Since you have chosen this course, we assume that you want to become **great artists**.

**Tools change, a lot. Especially in today's very dynamic digital age.** 

# Your primary study
BA Games Design and Art is, as the name suggests, a programme which aims to expand your knowledge and practice of design methodology and wider art context. This is the main focus of your study and is covered through your weekly lectures.

The programme does NOT have a requirement for game development skills, you may be coming in with a lot, a little, or no programming experience. That is ok. But you may be asking yourself:

"I understand all this, but I will still need to create a digital game at some point, right?!"

Correct, and actually this will be much sooner than you expect. In order to cater to the vast array of skills, interests, and goals, we have the GDA Tech Stream.
