# Notice

Please be mindful of noise especially if there are classes happening in the studio. We are very happy to see that the games room is being used as a social space but this relies on mutual understanding between all students.

**If you are using the AV system, please remember to lock it afterwards as the studio regularly has external visitors.** The cabinet padlock code can be shared with Games students on request, but please do not share it externally.

Lastly, if you are borrowing any equipment from Studio 32 please remember to return it so that it can be easily found by others when needed.
