# Polite Notice

A reminder that the upkeep of studios and other university spaces is a joint responsibility between all students (BA Games Design or otherwise) and staff. Please respect these spaces by keeping them clean, maintained and accessible to improve the experience of your peers and to reduce unnecessary workload on cleaning and technical staff:

- If you are using a desk in Studio 32 or the Computer Suite, please clear it after use (you may use the pigeonhole cabinet in the computer suite to temporary store paper as well any unused lockers throughout the studio).
  
- Please do not leave dirty plate/cups/cutlery in the studio. Kitchen items borrowed from the cafe should be returned on the same day or shortly after. You can keep personal items (such as water bottles and cups) on your desk or in a locker as long as they are clean. If there any spills or big messes, please use the cleaning supplies located in Studio 32 or let a member of staff know.

- Please avoid using permanent markers on the studio whiteboards - compatible markers will have a "whiteboard" or "dry erase" label.
