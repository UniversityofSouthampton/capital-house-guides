Addons can be accessed or installed in Edit -> Preferences... -> Addons. Built-in addons are already installed with Blender and can be searched for and enabled in this screen, while others must be installed manually:

# Modelling
## LoopTools (Built-In)
A whole bunch of tools to help with modelling, especially when changing the shape of edge loops. Loops can be shaped into perfect circles, smoothed down, etc.
## Auto Mirror
Automatically splits your model in half and applies the Mirror modifier, so it can be perfectly symmetrical on that axis. Great for character modelling.

# 3D Printing
## 3D Print Toolbox (Built-In)
Blender can be used to created meshes for 3D printing. Meshes exported from Blender are usually imported into a piece of software takes the mesh and “slices” it into paths that the 3D printer can execute. An example of such [Slicer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicer_\(3D_printing\)) software is [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/).

In order to correctly slice a mesh, it needs to be “watertight”, meaning that the surface is closed everywhere. Additionally, there should be no edges or faces sticking out. 3D Print Toolbox helps you analyze problems in your mesh that could cause slicing issues.
